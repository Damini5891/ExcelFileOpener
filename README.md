<b>Excel File Opener</b>
It's a Python script that creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The GUI allows users to select an Excel file (.xlsx) using a file dialog window and then displays the selected file's name in a message box. Additionally, it attempts to read the selected Excel file using pandas and prints its contents to the console.
